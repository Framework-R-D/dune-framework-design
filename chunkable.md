## Introduction

### What is the nature of a chunkable data product? 

* Call the separate pieces that are processed chunks

* How does the framework recognize that a given type is chunkable?

### How do we read a chunkable data product? 

* How do we tell the IO system that we need to chunk the data product that we want to read?

### How do we write a chunkable data product? 

* How do we tell the IO system that we need to chunk the data product that we want to write?

### What higher order functions that framework will provide that can take advantage of the chunkable data product as input?

* this may include what is expected from user defined algorithms 

* requirements may vary with the kind of higher order function, e.g. for transformation 

### What higher order functions that framework will provide that can take advantage of the chunkable data product as output?


### What higher order functions that framework will provide that can take advantage of the chunkable data product both as input and output?
