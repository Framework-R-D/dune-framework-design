Conceptual design
*****************

.. admonition:: Purpose

   The conceptual design is not a reference manual; it is a high-level description of how the framework aims to satisfy the stakeholder requirements (see :numref:`Appendix %s <requirements:Framework requirements>`).
   The audience for the conceptual design is the physicist, algorithm author, or framework program runner.
   A more technical description of the intended design is given in :numref:`Chapter %s <technical_design:Technical design>`.
