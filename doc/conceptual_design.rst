Conceptual design

.. admonition:: Purpose

   The conceptual design is not a reference manual; it is a high-level description of how the framework aims to satisfy the :ref:`stakeholder requirements <requirements:Framework requirements>`.
   The audience for the conceptual design is the physicist, algorithm author, or framework program runner.
   A more technical description of the intended design is given :ref:`here <technical_design:Technical design>`.

   In general, I would suggest avoiding generic reference labels like "here," or "link."
