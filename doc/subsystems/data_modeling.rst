Data modeling
=============

.. todo::

   - Provides a mechanism for connecting in-memory data representations with information needed by the IO backends to read-and-write the data
   - Responsible for ensuring the same data product is representable in the supported languages
   - May need to translate from one in-memory representation to another when crossing a language boundary
