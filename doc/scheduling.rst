Building the data-flow graph
============================

Phlex adopts the data-flow approach discussed in the :ref:`section on data flow with sequences <data_flow:Data flow with sequences>`.
Using the function-centric view, sequences of data or, more accurately, *data-product sequences* are passed along the edges between higher-order functions that represent nodes :dune:`1.1 Algorithm Communication Via Data Products`.

The framework is a system of integrated aspects that must work together.
To illustrate how these subsystems are designed to work together, we use the below graph to describe each aspect.
